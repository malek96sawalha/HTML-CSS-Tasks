        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small
         carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species 
         in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the
          domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the
           wild members of the family. Cats are commonly 
           kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or 
           feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids
            human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans
             for companionship and their ability to kill small
              rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by 
              various cat registries
